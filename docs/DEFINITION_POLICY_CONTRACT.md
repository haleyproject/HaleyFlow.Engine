# Definition & Policy Contract

## Implemented validation and ordering

Engine and Relay imports share the snapshot reader and policy validator. Unknown policy states retain warning severity. Invalid rule shapes, hook types, ACK modes, completion destinations, and explicit order values are rejected before persistence. Policy imports require their definition. Only the last matching via-specific rule, or the last general fallback, emits hooks.

Explicit hook order ranges from 1 to 2147483646; omitted order is 2147483647 and always runs last. Rule completion never cascades into hook completion. See [recovery changes](PROTOCOL_RECOVERY_CHANGES.md) for the complete runtime contract and migration.

Rules governing how workflow definition JSON and policy JSON are parsed, validated, and executed.
Applies equally to the relay (`WorkflowRelay`) and the engine (`WorkFlowEngine`).

## 1. Definition JSON Structure

### States
- Every state has a `name`.
- Exactly **one** state must be marked `is_initial: true` — this is the entry point.
- One or more states may be marked `is_final: true` — these are terminal states.
- A state not marked `is_final` but with no outgoing transitions is a structural error.

### Transitions
- Each transition has: `from`, `to`, `event` (numeric code), optional `eventName`.
- Event codes must be **unique per FromState** — duplicate codes from the same state are ambiguous.
- `FromState` and `ToState` must both exist in the states list — mismatches indicate spelling mistakes.

### Self-loops
- A self-loop (`from == to`) with **no other exit transitions** from that state is a critical error — guaranteed infinite loop.
- A self-loop with other exit transitions is a warning — likely intentional (reminder, timeout ping).

## 2. Policy JSON Structure

### Top-level params catalog
```json
"params": [
  { "code": "PARAMS.LOAN.MANAGER.APPROVAL", "data": { ... } }
]
```
- Defines named parameter entries available to rules and hooks.
- `code` is the unique key. `data` is a free-form object (approval rules, role selectors, thresholds, etc.).

### Rules
```json
"rules": [
  {
    "state": "ManagerApproval",
    "via": 2005,
    "params": [ "PARAMS.LOAN.MANAGER.APPROVAL" ],
    "complete": { "success": 2007, "failure": 2008 },
    "emit": [ ... ]
  }
]
```

- `state` — the state being **arrived at** (ToState). The rule fires when this state is entered.
- `via` — optional. If present, the rule only applies when the state is entered via this specific event code. If absent, the rule applies to all transitions that arrive at this state.
- `params` — optional list of param codes from the top-level catalog. Applied to the transition and inherited by hooks unless overridden.
- `complete` — optional. Defines auto-advance event codes for the transition handler (`success`, `failure`).
- `emit` — list of hooks to fire upon arrival at this state.

### Hooks (emit entries)
```json
{
  "route": "APP.LOAN.MANAGER.DECISION",
  "label": "Manager Approval Decision",
  "blocking": true,
  "order": 1,
  "complete": { "success": 2007, "failure": 2008 },
  "params": [ "PARAMS.LOAN.MANAGER.APPROVAL" ]
}
```

- `route` — unique identifier for the hook handler.
- `blocking` — if `true`, failure stops the chain. If `false`, result is ignored entirely.
- `order` — execution sequence. Hooks without an order run **last** (treated as `int.MaxValue`). Once any hook defines an order, unordered hooks are pushed to the end.
- `complete` — optional. Hook-own success/failure event codes. Only respected on **blocking** hooks.
- `params` — optional. Hook-own param codes. If absent, inherits parent rule's param codes.

---

## 3. Parameter Resolution

| Context | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Transition handler | `transition.ParamCodes` (from the rule-level `params`) |
| Hook handler | Hook-own `params` if defined; falls back to parent rule `params` if not |

Parameters are resolved into `ctx.Parameters` before each handler call so business logic can read approval rules, roles, thresholds, etc. directly.

---

## 4. Execution Contract (NextAsync)

### Transition handler
| Outcome | Action |
|---|---|
| Handler returns `false` (failure) | Skip ALL hooks. Fire `CompleteFailureCode` immediately if set. If not set, return `Blocked`. |
| Handler returns `true` (success) | Hold `CompleteSuccessCode`. Run all hooks first. Fire success code AFTER all hooks complete. |

### Hooks (in `OrderSeq` order)
| Outcome | Action |
|---|---|
| Non-blocking hook (any result) | Continue to next hook. Complete codes on non-blocking hooks are **ignored entirely**. |
| Blocking hook fails + has `CompleteFailureCode` | Skip remaining hooks. Fire failure event immediately. |
| Blocking hook fails + no `CompleteFailureCode` + transition has `CompleteFailureCode` | Skip remaining hooks. Fire transition's failure event immediately. |
| Blocking hook fails + no failure path anywhere | Roll back `ctx.CurrentState` to `FromState`. Return `Blocked`. |
| Blocking hook succeeds + has `CompleteSuccessCode` | Capture success code. Continue remaining hooks. Fire after all hooks complete. |

### After all hooks
- Fire `pendingHookSuccessCode` if any blocking hook captured one — **hook success takes priority over transition handler success**.
- Otherwise fire `transitionNextCode` from the transition handler if set.
- Otherwise return `RelayResult.Ok(currentState)` — no auto-advance.

### Key invariants
- **Failure always fires immediately** — no further hooks run after a failure event is resolved.
- **Success always waits** — fired only after all hooks complete.
- **Non-blocking hooks cannot drive auto-advance** — complete codes on non-blocking hooks are silently ignored.
- **Rule-level complete codes do NOT cascade to hooks** — each hook's complete codes come only from its own `complete` block.
- **State advances before hooks run** — `ctx.CurrentState` is set to `ToState` before hook handlers are called. On blocking hook failure with no path, it is rolled back to `FromState`.

## 5. Validation Rules

### Structural errors (reject registration)

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `NO_INITIAL_STATE` | No state marked `is_initial` |
| `MULTIPLE_INITIAL_STATES` | More than one state marked `is_initial` |
| `UNKNOWN_FROM_STATE` | Transition `from` references a state not in the states list |
| `UNKNOWN_TO_STATE` | Transition `to` references a state not in the states list |
| `DUPLICATE_EVENT_CODE` | Same event code used twice from the same state |
| `TERMINAL_HAS_TRANSITIONS` | A terminal state has outgoing transitions |
| `STUCK_STATE` | Non-terminal state has no outgoing transitions |
| `CIRCULAR_ONLY` | A state's only outgoing transition is a self-loop — infinite loop guaranteed |
| `AMBIGUOUS_ORDER` | Multiple blocking hooks at the same order define complete codes |

### Structural warnings (allowed, informational)

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `UNREACHABLE_STATE` | State has no incoming transitions and is not the initial state |
| `SELF_LOOP_WITH_EXIT` | State has a self-loop but also has exit transitions — likely intentional |

### Policy warnings (allowed, informational)

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `POLICY_UNKNOWN_STATE` | Policy rule targets a state not in the definition — dead rule, never fires |
| `NON_BLOCKING_WITH_COMPLETE` | Non-blocking hook defines complete codes — ignored at runtime |
| `UNREACHABLE_HOOK` | Hook after a full-terminator (blocking hook with both success + failure codes) |
| `NO_FAILURE_PATH` | Blocking hook has no failure code and transition has no failure code — code-side Tier 2/3 must handle |

---

## 6. Pending Engine Audit

Once relay semantics are confirmed stable, audit `InstanceOrchestrator` and `MonitorOrchestrator` to verify the engine honours the same rules:

- `via` matching — hooks only applied when state entered via the specified event code
- Non-blocking hooks ignore complete codes
- Failure fires immediately, success waits for all hooks
- Param inheritance (hook-own first, rule fallback)
